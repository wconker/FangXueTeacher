ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project ShareSDK:/Users/softsea/Desktop/ShareSDK for
   Android/Libs/MainLibs/.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path src in project ShareSDK: ignored. The project
   may not compile if the given source path provided source code.


Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => ShareSDK/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/MobCommons-2017.1201.1507.jar => ShareSDK/libs/MobCommons-2017.1201.1507.jar
* libs/MobTools-2017.1201.1507.jar => ShareSDK/libs/MobTools-2017.1201.1507.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-Core-3.1.2.jar => ShareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-Core-3.1.2.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-Email-3.1.2.jar => ShareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-Email-3.1.2.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-Facebook-3.1.2.jar => ShareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-Facebook-3.1.2.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-QZone-3.1.2.jar => ShareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-QZone-3.1.2.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-ShortMessage-3.1.2.jar => ShareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-ShortMessage-3.1.2.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-SinaWeibo-3.1.2.jar => ShareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-SinaWeibo-3.1.2.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-TencentWeibo-3.1.2.jar => ShareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-TencentWeibo-3.1.2.jar
* libs/ShareSDK-Twitter-3.1.2.jar => ShareSDK/libs/ShareSDK-Twitter-3.1.2.jar
* res/ => ShareSDK/src/main/res/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
